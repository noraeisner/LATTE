This script is designed to test the LATTE python code to ensure that the server response is working. 

NOTE: requires connection to the internet and to the archive database. If these tests fail, first check that these connections 
are working by accessing the website: https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/download_scripts/ in a browser.
