Overview of LATTE scipts:

__main__.py      : Intitialises the parameters, what TIC ID, sector, checks for downloads of the data, FFI or not?

LATTEutils.py    : All the functions needed to download data and text files, runs the interactive gui, all of the plotting and data handling.

LATTE_DV.py      : Scipt to combine all of the results from LATTEbrew in order to generate a pdf data validation report.

LATTEbrew.py     : Calls the LATTEutils functions in turn in order to store the results and keeps track of what has been generated. Calls the LATTE_DV.py function to collate all the results.


This scipt has two functions, one for the short cadence data and one for the FFI data.
These functions are either called from within __main__.py (if run with input target list), or from within the interact functions in LATTEutils.py (normal mode).

Brew keeps track if any part of the code crashes (e.g. the downloading of the TPF - so that these are omitted in the generation of the DV report).
